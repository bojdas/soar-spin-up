# Introduction
ARMS is a library that greatly simplifies programming the chassis of a vex v5 robot.  
**DISCLAIMER**: This library was designed with standard tank drive bases in mind. If your bot has an X-drive, mecanum drive, H-drive, or any other non-standard type of drive, this library will not work without significant modifications (you may be better off writing your own drive code).
